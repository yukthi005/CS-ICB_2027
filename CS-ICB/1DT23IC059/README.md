# Banking System

This project is a simple banking system implemented in Python. It allows users to perform core banking operations such as:

- *Account Management*: Create, view, and manage bank accounts.
- *Transactions*: Deposit, withdraw, and transfer funds between accounts.
- *Transaction History*: View detailed transaction records with timestamps.
- *Passbook Generation*: Generate a formatted passbook for account activity.

### Key Features:
- *Object-Oriented Design*: Encapsulates account properties and behaviors for modularity and reusability.
- *Data Persistence*: Uses file handling to save and load account and transaction data.
- *User-Friendly Interface*: A menu-driven interface for easy interaction.
- *Error Handling*: Prevents invalid transactions, such as overdrafts or transfers to non-existent accounts.
- *Unique Account Numbers*: Automatically generates unique account numbers for each user.

### Technologies Used:
- Python
- File Handling (Pickle module)
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

1. Clone the repository.
